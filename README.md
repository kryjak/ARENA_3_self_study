# ARENA 3 self study
Some notebooks from the [ARENA 3.0](https://github.com/callummcdougall/ARENA_3.0) curriculum I needed to go through to prepare for my [Pivotal Fellowship](https://www.pivotal-research.org/fellowship).

- [0.0]: Prerequisites, basics of PyTorch, einops + einsum
- [1.1]: Transformers from scratch. Learn exactly how a transformer works, implement it yourself
- [1.2]: Mechanistic interpretability.
- *[1, 4]: Will probably go through superposition and SAEs as I might need them for my project.*
